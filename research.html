                        Summary: We provide new empirical evidence of disagreement between investors in the S&P 500 options market. Our findings rely on high-frequency intraday price and volume data for options on the S&P 500 index. We find that investors have higher disagreement about rare events and about events farther into the future, as opposed to lower disagreement about common events or events in the near future.

                        Understanding Large Moves in Risk Neutral Moments

                    <div class="summary">
                        Summary: We recover higher order moments of the S&P 500 index at the high-frequency. These moments are computed using model-free measures and depend on high-frequency observations of options data. Consistent with a model where there are sudden changes in the probability of price jumps, we find evidence of large and frequent moves in the risk-neutral moments, far in excess of the number of jumps in the market index.

                        Summary: We analyze the relationship between market jumps and the implied volatility in the options market. We find a negative correlation between jumps in the market index and changes in the implied volatility, which contradicts the assumptions of many well known options pricing models.
